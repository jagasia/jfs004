React Js
-----------
have learnt to create a project
we create components in two ways:
	class
	function

functions inside a class based component?
how to make those functions as event handlers?

props
	arg for constructor

	constructor(props)
	{}

	are a meant for sending input to the component.

	<LoginComponent />
	<LoginComponent color="red" backgroundColor="blue" />
	
		props.color			will give us "red"
		props.backgroundColor	will give us "blue"

	props are read only. one way, a parent component can send input to the child component using props.
	
state
	is internal to the component.
	in a component, there can be lot of functions/methods
	across these functions we can use the state

	suppose, if i send this component to a rest api, this goes like an object.

	state is preserved across events/ function calls

	it is not read only
	it is not an input from parent
	
	in constructor, we can declare a state as an object			JSON		{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}

	we can update the state



npx create-react-app may17-first




render()
{
	return <div>
		everything else should be inside this container
	</div>

}
