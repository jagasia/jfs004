spring data jpa

findById
	is there in jpa
findByLastName
	there is no such method

for such application specific requirements, we may sometimes have to write queries.

Not SQL query, but JPA QL
EJBQL
HQL
JPAQL

In all these querying languages, we do not write query on the table. 

select * from EMPLOYEE;		//this is SQL
select e from Employee e;		//this is JPAQL
	Notice, Employee is the spelling of the class. not the table	

@Entity
@Table(name="EMP)
public class Employee
{



@Repository
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer>
{
	@Query("select s from Student s where s.lastName=:ln")
	public List<Student> findStudentsByLastName(@Param("ln")String lastName);
}




group by
order by
distinct

we can write our own queries in jpa repository using @Query

select firstName from .......

public String


public List<String>

@Data
class Output
{
	String firstName;
	String lastName;

}

@Query("select firstName,lastName from....
select List<Output> findMethod

------------------------------------
Relationships

Employee
Department


One Department has Many Employees

One To Many

Many To Many


@OneToMany

Whenever an anotation ends with "Many", jpa will create a new table. TO PREVENT THAT, use "mappedBy" attribute
