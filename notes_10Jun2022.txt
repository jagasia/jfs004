Enhancement project
	choose 1 project
		import it and check document and implement the changes
	90% to work on existing project only.
	new project is very rare

	video learning

	step into
	step over
	step out

break point			pause at this point. From this point, you will use 

run a project
debug a project

Run As


step into
	go next line
	but if next line is a method, 
		it will go inside the method and step line by line
		time consuming. if you have already tested this method, why should we go line by line
			step out to exit the current method
step over
	go next line
	if next line is a method, the entire method is completed like a single line


step out
	exit the current method


windows
	local variables
	change detection		red color for the variable which has just changed

LOGICAL ERRORS
	loop is expected to run 10 times
		but it executed 11 times or 9 times		is an example for logical error.

Feign client
--------------
how can we call a controller from another controller using URL?

from reactjs you know how to call a controller by using URL
	axios

from one rest api, how do you call another rest api?
	feign client


1) download a project from 
	start.spring.io
2) run the project in cmd prompt

	do both of these without using eclipse/sts




How will i understand a rest api?
	if i do not understand, how will i know the json format to add an entity?

	we need a documentation.

How can we create documentation for a rest api?
	normally, SOAP webservices have documentation.	 WSDL		
	But for rest api? by default there is no documentation.
	we can create a documentation using swagger.


Demo:
	1) REST Api
	2) Swagger		(no need for postman)
	3) Feign client

Product
	id
	name
	price


firstName	=	FIRST_NAME		default strategy
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
firstName=	firstName		only when you use above strategy



create an interface that is annotated with feign client
	url

this interface can be autowired in a controller
