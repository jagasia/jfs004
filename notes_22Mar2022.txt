1) Object oriented program
	every code is written atleast inside the class or interface

	in c++,
		we can run a program with just main method 
		variable
		functions

	in java
		even if you want to run hello world program,	there will be a class

2) compilation process
	in c, c++	
		we write source code. After compilation, we get object code	
		this object code is specific to machine	it is machine language

		so if i compile a program in a particular type of machine		16 bit machine
		that compiled version of program will run only in such platforms.
		because, while compiling, the machine specific translation happens

	in java,
		we write source code. After compilation, it is not converted to machine language.
		bcos we write java programs from our computer. Later, we run them in client's computer.	What if our computer and client's computer
		were different platform.

		the compiled code is a byte code.

		while running this compiled code, at run time, it is further translated into the machine language.

		JRE is available for different platforms

lab setup:
----------
	should i download
		JDK?

		JRE?

	you download JDK because, you are developer. Java development kit.		JDK includes JAVAC also

	the customers need just JRE		java runtime environment		does not javac. but have java interpreter to run the compiled code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
core java is java 8 that we learn



eclipse / spring tool suite STS

1) download jdk 8
2) install


----------------------------------------------
Java language
there are 8 primitive data types
	byte				-128 to 127			8 bit 		1 byte
	short				-32768 to 32767			16 bit		2 bytes
	int				-2147483648 to 2147483647		32 bit		4 bytes
	long				-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807	64 bit	8 bytes

	float				4 bytes
	double				8 bytes

	char				2 bytes		unicode		

	boolean				1 bit		true or false

types
	String
	Date
	Employee		(user defined type)



my first java program


get input
mathematical or logical operations
display output

Operators:
------------
%			5%2	is 1		after dividing 5/2, the reminder is 1
			4/6	is 4

>>	
<<

2		0000 0010		2
2>>1		0000 0001		1		division by 2

2<<1		0000 0100		4		division by 4

?:		ternary operator		if else

(x>y)?true:false

logical
	!			
	&&
	||

precedence		BODMAS	



for getting input, from jdk 1.5 onwards, we use Scanner
	


Scanner methods
	nextLine()			this reads the input until a "newline" or "enter" or "return" key is found

	next()
	nextInt()
	nextFloat()


next() vs nextLine()

next() is suitable for getting one word input String.

because, space is also a delimiter
tab is a delimiter
new line is also a delimiter


""

what happens when you gent input like this
