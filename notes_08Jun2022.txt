Jenkins
------------
	Creating jobs that can
		run programs	
		integrate/ deploy applications from repositories like git		CI/CD


is a web application	(war)
download jenkins war file

how do we run any .war file?
	java -jar <<war file name>>

		8080



we will deploy the project in git hub
and using the git hub url, jenkins will run the project.
That means, we are deployer who will setup the jenkins to run the project from git.

The developer whenever they want to update the project, they will just push the project to git.
The changes reflect when jenkins run next time.
