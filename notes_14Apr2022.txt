when we submitted this solution in hackerrank, it said, the program took more time than expected. NOT ACCEPTED

Stage 2 demo:
------------------
Maven
	what is maven?
		build tool		

		IMO, a build tool is very useful that
		even without an IDE, i should be able to work

	right click you project in eclipse, and go to compiler, change the compiler level (if your jdk is 16, you can choose version 8 or 11 or anything upto 16)
	jar / war

	in cmd prompt
		maven, allow us to do all these things using cmd line CLI

	build
		compilation
		.jar file/ .war file/ .ear file
	

	i am not adding .jar files into my project
		during JDBC, mysql-connector.jar		or 		ojdbc6.jar

	jar files always increase the size of the project.
	so when i push the project to GIT/ cloud, size of the project also matters

	when i add jar files to my project,	
		every project will have a copy of the jar files.


	managing jar files means, when version changes
		remove and add only specific jar files from the build path


	you are creating a project in eclipse	
		dynamic web project
		java project

	each project has some template.
		without eclipse how to obtain that template?
	maven has lot of project archetypes

Lab setup:
-------------
	what is installing maven???????
		there is no installer

	download maven
		download apache maven	(for windows, ZIP file)
		unzip to a folder
			C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation

	and set environment variable to this location


		path		C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281\bin		is appended
		JAVA_HOME	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281


	WHAT are the environment variables to be created for maven?

		M2_HOME
			C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.6.3

		M2
			C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.6.3\bin
			%M2_HOME%\bin
		append to the
		Path	
			%M2%


	CMD
		mvn -version

		
---------------------------------------------------
Lets create our first maven project 
	
	File	
		New
			maven project

different archetypes	(each archetype  is a project template)

for core java project:		quickstart
for web app		webapp

	group id	com.cts.hrms			.	.	.
	artifact id	user-service			-	-	-
	package name



Repository


Task:
	create a "quickstart" archetype maven project
	run the project


pom.xml
	Project Object Model
	this represent a metadata or configuration or build information about the project

	java version
	build type		.jar/ .war
	dependencies
		jar files


maven has a centralized repository of all the jar files

	you want a mysql connector jar??
		there is a maven dependency

https://mvnrepository.com/
	is the central / remote repository of jar files
	

now, in our system, computer, we have a local repository also

Whenever a project, pom.xml adds a dependency,
	that jar file is downloaded to local repository (only if that jar file is not present in the local repository)
	
	where is this local repository?
		c:\users\<<username>>\.m2
