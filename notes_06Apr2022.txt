Everybody has got their java code challenge enabled

------------------------------------------------
1) String split method
	i) you are using regex to split
		problem when you split an ip address		192.168.0.2
		str.split(".");			. is not a character. it is a symbol in regex. . means anything
		str.split("\\.");			here, \ in regex treats next char as a character than a symbol
	ii) after splitting, you get an array of strings		entire list is stored in an array
2) StringTokenizer
	i) split by character		NOT by regex
	ii) you can loop for 1 portion at a time. 	RATHER than storing entire result in an array



int i;
String str;

i=sc.next();
str=sc.nextLine();		//here only you have problem
if(str.equals(""))
{
	str=sc.nextLine();
}
