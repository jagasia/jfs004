React Js
----------
	created a react app
	created components
	state vs props
	functions and event handling
	
Services
--------------
	Remember the spring boot apps we created for MVC project?
	service classes provide business logic
		ex:
			CRUD		

Suppose, in a project
	front end
	back end
		this back end would be usually a REST api	(you will learn rest api soon)
		rest api, is a spring boot app

Front end
	should be able to call the REST api (backend)


Lets see how our react app is able to access a REST api.

we can take some of the rest apis available in internet.

https://api.instantwebtools.net/v1/airlines

	read()		returns all the airlines
	read(id)		returns 0/1 airline 


JSON
	JavaScript Object Notation
	{"id":"1","name":"Jag Airlines"}

	{id:"1",name:"Jag Airlines"}			this is object in javascript

	JSON.stringify();			converts the object into JSON string
	JSON.parse();			converts the json string into an object



How can a react app access REST API?
	axios

install axios
	npm install axios


any call to rest api, returns a promise.

A promise is an async method call.

the output comes any time. may not be immediately

and our program will proceed


lifecycle methods of a react component

init
destroy
