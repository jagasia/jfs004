Hands on
-------------


1) create a spring boot app
	java
	version
	jar/war			(a rest api is .jar)
	dependencies
		spring web
		spring data jpa
		mysql driver
2) instead of @Controller, use @RestController

	no need for "prefix", "suffix"
	no need to create WEB-INF/views folder/ jsp files NOT REQUIRED

3) all other things
	@Entity
	@Repository
	@Service
	@RestController

4) Rest controller
	autowire the service

	create methods 
		@GetMapping		=>	@RequestMapping(method="GET"
	you can use request mapping also. NO problem

test them in post man

5) under @RestController annotation, use
	@CrossOrigin(origins={"http://localhost:3000","*"})

	this will allow, our rest api to be accessed from given urls

Cloud
	What is cloud?

Answers from our participants:
		computing through internet
		remote server where we can store data
		network of servers connected using internet
		used to store data
		network, storage, multiple resources from any platform
		pay as you go
		
	
The following are the broad category of services offered by Cloud:
	Computing
	Storage
	Networking


Paradigm shift in the IT industry.
	Earlier, we were delivering products to the clients.
	Now, we are providing services to the clients.


Infrastructure as a Service
Platform as a Service
Software as a Service


MS Office
	Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc

if i sell a product, (ms office), the customer will pay you once.
this product is vulnerable to piration.


There is Office 365
Microsoft 365	is the new name 

office.com
	This is also MS Office, but not a product but a service

This is cloud model.

match the following

OnePlus vs Airtel


which is product and which is service?

Airtel is providing service
OnePlus is selling product


product vs service

service is scalable 
	means, 
		You need more? you subscribe more.

	ability to provision according to our need

5 Gb
10 Gb
2 Gb

Technically,

Product has limitations
Service have more advantage

product once delivered, is detached from the seller

service is up to date

In MS Office, if you buy a CD/DVD

new features???? the product is not aware of new features


Cloud
--------
	You focus on your application development related areas.
	Cloud service providers take care of the all other areas.


I am good in angular & java.
I can develop a website using these technologies

But i am not good in infrastructure.

After developing the web app, we need to deploy it in server

I am not good in networking/ server architectures.

Cloud service provider will take care of infra structure.

Cloud gives that luxury that you take care of your core business area



Cinema industry
--------------------

How to allow audience to book ticket online?????

they will not do this. 

BookMyShow app



Microsoft
	Azure

Google
	GCP

Amazon
	AWS

These are giant cloud service providers


	Computing
	Storage
	Networking



They allow us to store our files in the central repository
	Storage cloud
		google drive
		github
		dropbox

	i have my own virtual space

adv
	i can access my folder using any device
		i didn't bring my laptop. But this cloud, i can access from my mobile. I can access from any computer (connected to internet)

i have done a project in spring boot/ servlet/ jsp
if i upload this into my storage cloud, then it cannot run there.
	you can download

Git
	has storage. But programs does not run at git.


storage is enough for sharing files/ folders or central repository


----------------------

Compute cloud
	not only storage service. but the cloud server is capable of running the applications or provide Runtime environment for the applications

domain hosting package
	free doman name registration	
		jagindia.com
	space
		30 Gb

when i upload html, css, javascript files
	it works fine

index.html		becomes home page

Problem started when i uploaded my .war file

.war means, web archive ie., dynamic web project

servlets, jsp are server side scripts that run in server

my server was incapable of running java 

apache tomcat server

AWS
	EC2
		Elastic Compute Cloud


Elasticity
	Elastic Scalability
	
what is the difference between Scalability & Elasticity?
	Scalability		(with given/ fixed infrastructure)
		is the ability to adapt to growing or reducing needs
			need more? subscribe more
	Elasticity
		is scalability by privisioning or deprovisioning infrastructure


if your phone has the capability to increase RAM or memory card, then it is elasticity
sometimes, Server computers have the provision to add hard disks

Mainframes allow adding more processors

Task:
What is IaaS?
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/
	not only for development, mostly for deployment
	0 down time

Identify and tell

What is PaaS?		compute
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/
	development environment for creating softwares

What is SaaS?
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/
	office 365
	zoho books
		accounting software

Javascript & Jquery 
-------------------------
type of questions
	1) a code will be given. You should predict the output
		space matters
		2 answers look alike. But notice there is a space difference
	2) which of the following true
		which of the following is NOT true
	

in javascript, 
	space, tab, new line all these are ignored
	; is optional

you are familiar with 
	document.getElementById
you can answer one question

When all answers look like same,
compare 1st and 2nd answer
	there will be a difference
	only 1 is correct another is wrong
compare 2nd and 3rd
do this same way

Where do you put javscript code?

HEAD
BODY
STYLE
DIV
SPAN
P

which company invented javascript?

which datatype is not supported in javascript?

what type of language is javascript?

in javascript
	document.getElementById("txt1").value="India";
in jquery
	instead of value what we use?
		val()

in jquery which symbol is used?	
	$

in javascript
	.style.backgroundColor="blue:
in jquery
	.css("background-color","yellow");

how will you hide an element in jquery?
	.hide()


$(this).hide();		//means, current element is hidden

<span>india</span>

how to make this span background color blue

jquery is based on which language?

can we make jquery stop for some time?
	delay()


when i compared javascript and jquery yesterday
i show an example for ajax


function loadDoc() {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
      this.responseText;
    }
  };
  xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
  xhttp.send();
}

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $.ajax({url: "demo_test.txt", success: function(result){
            $("#div1").html(result);
        }});
    });
});
</script>


for ajax, jquery uses
	$.ajax method

	ajax


ternary operator symbol

in javascript,
we used a method to add or remove elements to an array
	Splice

onclick
onblur
onfocus
onchange
onerror
	whenever error is occurred


you know getElementById
but there are other methods also

getElementsByName		plural	elements

getElementsbyTagName()
