terminologies

TABLE
ROW	RECORD		TUPLE
COLUMN			FIELD
DATA
NULL		nothing	- 	information missing	-	null is not a space 		null is not 0	

operators

PROJECTION	A table may have lot of columns, but we project only certain columns	SELECT * FROM TABLE1 	instead of *, if you specify specific columns, then you are doing PROJECTION
SELECTION	A table may have lot of records, but we select only certain records based on condition(s). 	WHERE
UNION		combine the result of 2 queries			addition		+	Some records found common in both queries are produced only once.	5+5	may not always be 10
INTERSECT	find only the records common among 2 queries	
MINUS		all records obtained from first query, minus the common records from between second query
UNION ALL	INCLUDING DUPLICATE RECORDS		5+5=10
DIVIDE		all the rows from 1st query, that has matching records with all the rows in second query



3 customers
3 products

how many customers have purchased all the 3 products?????	DIVIDE


PRODUCT
		whenever you do join 			JOIN
		cartesian product. that means, all rows in first table are considered to have matching records with all rows in second table
		if you have join condition, then it is PRODUCT	(Not cartesian product)


Normalization
	aim is to reduce the redundancy

ARRIVE AT A VERY SCIENTIFICALLY DESIGNED TABLE STRUCTURE

in step/ stage, your table conforms to a Normal Form

1NF	
2NF
3NF

BCNF


a table is said to be in 1NF if every cell in the table has precisely only 1 data

address columns

124, Raja street, Coimbatore - 641002


while doing business intelligence, we need to find candidates from Coimbatore

split this address column into

dno	street	city	pincode
124	Raja st	Coimb..	641002



Year	Sem
1	I

1	II



2NF
a table is said to be 2NF if it is already in 1NF and every attribute is functionally dependent on whole key

student table has columns only related to the student

Attendance table should not have all student details


3NF
a table is said to be 3NF if it is already in 2NF and every attribute is functionally dependent on primary key


STUDENT
sid, sname, dob, a1, a2, city, pincode, state
		Kolkata, 11111, Rajastan

why this inconsistency happened?

State is not dependent on the student, because, city is there. 

state is dependent on city

city master table



STUDENT_DETAILS
STUDENT_AC_DETAILS
STUDENT_PERSONAL_DETAILS
STUDENT_PROJECT_DETAILS



BCNF
	Boyce Codd

if the table has more than 1 candidate key and they are composite and they are overlapping



co1	col2	col3	col4



primary key
foreign key

candidate key		is any column(s) that is/are used to find a row uniquely. It is a candidate for primary key
alternate key		any candidate key which is not primary key, is called as alternate key
super key



composite key		more than 1 column combined to find a row uniquely


name, father's name, dob, address, city

name, dob			it may be unique



a primary key can be composite

example for a primary key which is composite

have you seen a departmental store bill

one bill contains
	lot of items

how they store these items in the bill table?

BILLNO	ITEMNO	QTY	......
1	102	2
1	103	1
1	111	3
1	122	2



SELECT * FROM BILLS WHERE BILLNO=1;


BILLNO and  ITEMNO	together is a primary key in this table

this is a composite primary key


STUDENT PROJECT TABLE
SID	PID
