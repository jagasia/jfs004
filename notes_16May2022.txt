		we have to install node js


now, we have downloaded and installed the node js
	cmd

v16.14.0


nodejs also includes npm

we will  use npm to install many other softwares like
	react
	bootstrap
	ts
	axios

--------------------

What is the need for Reactjs
	we need to create front end

HTML
CSS
Javascript
bootstrap

They we not component based / Object oriented approach

login
	what is login

		html form which has text boxes,  buttons, labels, etc
		js code that accepts input and calls the api
		css/ bootstrap styling

	all these together is a Login Component. But in reality, these are just lot of files

suppose, i am placing the login component in first column of the bootstrap row

suddenly we need to move to third column.
	What we do?
		cut lot of code in html? and paste in in another location?

	difficult to manage.

we need a component based approach, so that i can easily manage the application

modules
	component
		html, css, js


npm install -g create-react-app

npx create-react-app first-project

every react app will have a "node_modules"

after creating the project
	go inside the project folder
		cd first-project
			code .		(opens the current project folder in visual studio code)
			npm start		(to run the project)


We are developing SPA
	Single Page Application
		the entire project is a single page. Home page
		if suppose, there are lot nav/menus	
			about us
			contact us
			Products
			Categories

	each can be a separate component.
	you can show them in the app component

app component is the root component.

Other components can be plugged in the app component


A component can be created in two ways:
	class based component
	function based component


for bootstrap
	npm install bootstrap

go to index.js
	

all the components may be placed in "Components" folder
