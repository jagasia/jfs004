Spring security
------------------

REST api is created by 1 enterprise
VIEW/ UI/ Front end can be created by many enterprises

	INOX

Book tickets online
INOX created a website inox.com

database
rest api

now, can you believe, we can book tickets for inox theatre from
	book my show app also?????

inox creates a db only once
	they create a REST api only once

but how many people create front end for that????????
 how do you trust them and how do you allow them to access your api methods (that makes transaction)

can we ask them to write their own authentication code?????

	never

rest api to have security

separates the roles of security and the dveloper

in my controller, i will  not be writing the code for authentication.

it is a cross cutting concern.

Parallely some layer is created

JWT

Before we go in details. Lets start understanding security f/w with demo

Basic demo:
---------------
	whenever we add "security" dependency in pom.xml, what happens?


spring data jpa
	when you add this dependency in pom.xml, what happens?
		without configuring the url, username, password, etc it is not possible to run our project

spring security has auto configuration
	it will generate a random password


SecurityAutoConfiguration


a password is generated (see in console) 
user name is "user"


spring.security.user.name=jag
spring.security.user.password=atshay


Demo

configure my application so that it will validate the login using code

implements WebSecurityConfigurer		(interface)
extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter		(class)		an adapter is an empty implementation of an interface



1) Entity
	User.java
2) Repository
	UserRepository
3) Service
	UserService
4) Configuration
	MyConfiguration
5) Controller
	MyController




return new User(username, password, new ArrayList<>());

User is an implementation of UserDetails
