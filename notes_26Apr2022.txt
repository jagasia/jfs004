Servlet, JSP 
Spring boot MVC 
-------------------------------------

Before spring was introduced, how did we develop a web application (using java server side scripts)

for client side scripting, we used javascript.

for server side, we used "Servlets & JSP"

they run on a server.
	ex for server:
		there were lot of web servers but they were not capable for providing a run time environment for java programs
		app servers (web app server) provide not only storage for web pages, but also they provide run time env for servlets and jsp

	sun java app server
	glass fish
	apache tomcat server
	weblogic
	websphere

dynamic web applications (using java)
	apache tomcat server

before downloading, check what are the versions supported by eclipse/ sts

download:
https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.62/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.62-windows-x64.zip

maven project
	arche type:		webapp
normal project
	dynamic web project		(like "java project" for core java)

after creating a maven "webapp" archetype project
	right click the project
		targeted runtimes



Servlet
	a java program that runs in server

scriplet
	applet		runs in browser	(browser support is required)
	servlet		runs in server and produces output that can be displayed in the browser (browser does not need any plugins)
	midlet		mobile interface device let		

JSP
	JSP page is converted into servlet at runtime

both servlets and JSPs are web components
	that are executed by a special JVM called as web container






spring allows me to create pojo classes
Plain Old Java Object

	servlet is not a pojo class

in spring
	Dispatcher servlet	already been created 	

	this will receive any request and call the suitable method of your POJO class




request		HttpServletRequest
response		HttpServletResponse

session		HttpSession
application		ServletContext

MVC 
	Model		
		Customer.java		define the data		data definition		create table
		CustomerDaoImpl.java	access the data		create, read, update, delete	DML
	View
		index.jsp		product.html (thymeleaf framework)
	Controller


Model
	any code that
		defines data
		access data

View
	input		<form>
	output		

Controller
	servlets		in spring?????		we dont create servlets
	code that 
		allows views to access model from anywhere in the world

		web component

spring mvc
	web.xml
	spring-servlet.xml

lot of configurations
	

spring boot mvc
	no need for xml configuration

spring vs spring boot
-------------------------
	spring boot is "convention" over "configuration"

	we follow conventions, then we don't need to configure

ex:
	in spring
		ComponentScan(basePackage="")

	in spring boot,
		we dont need to define this, if we create all classes under base package/ its sub package


the way we create the project itself is different
	spring boot project
		is created from start.spring.io			

	starter project
