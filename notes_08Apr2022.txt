lets create a flow for solving the problem:

1) download the skeleton
	we get a zip file (archive)	(not sure)
2) once downloaded, it will  show you the location where it is download. 
3) if it is zip, it is better to extract
	and ensure that you copy only the folder that contains "src"

	import a folder that contains directly "src"
4) how to import
	eclipse
		File-> Import -> General -> Existing project to workspace
5) script.sql
	we can run this script in sql work bench
	(drop the database before ict)
6) DBHandler.java
	understand the db.properties file (what is the variable name for driverclass/ url/ username/ password
		FileInputStream?
		ResourceBundle?
			anything is fine. But practice this.
	get connection 
7) entity class
	getters and setters
	one business method will be there (calculate kind of)
	do that

8) Business method
	1) validate
	2) a method that accepts FilePath and returns a list of entities
	3) a method that accepts List and either adds those list of entities to the db table. or select query
	4) main method to test your methods you have code


bad comments
	any java code, you comment it strike it
multiple return statement is bad
unclosed connection is bad
Scanner is not closed is bad			sc.close();
variables declared but not initialized
	String input="";
	double max;		//is bad
variable declared but not used.		//is bad
